# nozzle-health-analysis
This project presents a prototype automated inspection pipeline for detecting and quantifying contamination on inkjet nozzle plates using image processing techniques.  Inspired by industrial inkjet workflows, the goal is to simulate and analyze nozzle contamination patterns and develop quantitative metrics for nozzle health assessment.
